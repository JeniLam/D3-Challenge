          <p>The data used in this study comes from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau which includes state data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, healthcare coverage, median age and percentage of population which smokes. The chart is interactive, enabling you to click on different axis labels to update the data shown.  This allows the user to compare the relationships between the different variables.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When comparing the relationship between poverty and lacking healthcare there seems to be a positive correlation. As the poverty rate increases, so does the percentage of people who lack healthcare.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>When analyzing median age in 2014, a majority of the states fall into the "middle aged" category. When comparing the median age to smoking, obesity and lack of healthcare most states were clustered together, with Texas having the highest percentage of their population lacking healthcare.  </p>
            <br>
          <p>Moving into the median household income analysis, there is a negative corrlation to lacking healthcare. This correlation is expected, as the larger your income, the more likely a person is to afford medical benefits. Perhaps the most interesting note was in the increase in obesity the lower the income. However, when considering a lower income would not allow for healthier food options or gym memberships, this can be expected.</p>
