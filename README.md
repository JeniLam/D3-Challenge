# Creating Visualizations Using D3

## Summary
This project required usage of D3 vizualizations to create an interactive scatter plot between 2 data points based on the axis chosen by the user. Data was taken from [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) and includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 

### Visualizations 
Code for the vizualization is located in the app.js file and the project itself is hosted on my github page [D-3 Challenge](https://jenilam.github.io/D3-Challenge/)
